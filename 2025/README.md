# 2025

The 2025 course available at [cs193p.stanford.edu/2025 ↗](https://cs193p.stanford.edu/2025) focuses on building one core game, CodeBreaker, whilst introducing core Swift concepts such as Model, Generics, Animation, SwiftData and Multithreading. 

I revisited this course during a university semester break to refresh and consolidate my existing Swift knowledge, align with newer language features and frameworks, and reinforce best practices through a structured project.
