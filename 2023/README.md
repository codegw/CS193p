# 2023

The 2023 course available at [cs193p.stanford.edu/2023 ↗](https://cs193p.stanford.edu/2023) focuses on building two apps. An iOS card matching game named Memorize, introducing MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and animation concepts, and a document based iPadOS and Mac app Emoji Art, introducing gestures and error handling. 

These apps were built around iOS 16, therefore some code might be outdated, particularly the use of `@ObservableObject` as mentioned on the course site. The course provided a strong foundation in core Swift and SwiftUI concepts and significantly improved the quality and structure of my code across other projects.
